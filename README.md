Alone
=====

I haven't had too much time to test this, so I will be working on fixing bugs after submission and will merge the show stoppers into the compo entry. 

==== FIXED the issue with getting stuck on the second floor===== 
==== FIXED linking to the incorrect game ======= 

WASD to move around 
Space to interact 
Mouse to click empty word area 
Keyboard to enter text 

After you meet the janitor, you can solve the word puzzles in each apartment unit. Each apartment unit has a series of interactable items that tell a small story. Each story has or relates to the missing words in the room. 

I apologize if you don't like the music. I'm new to piano.. and just played what came to mind during the last 10 minutes of the compo. :) 

==================Spoiler================ 

The first puzzle is .. much harder than it should be. The answers for this room are "dies" and "believe". 

Unfortunately, I ran out of time and didn't get to go back to this puzzle to flesh it out a bit more.
